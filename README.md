## Welcome to TechLearn
I created this repository to track things that I have learnt over a period of time. It helps me to stay in touch with them and refer them as and when needed.
Please open [https://imsatyam.github.io/techlearn/](https://imsatyam.github.io/techlearn/) for better view.

## What it has?
Each concept has:
 * *video link(s):* An exhaustive detail of the concept through videos.
 * *textual link(s):* An exhaustive detail of the concept as a pdf or webpage link. It helps in brushing up concepts easily.
 * *notes:* crisp notes on the salient points of the concept. Helps in revision.

It will be great if this repository can help you in any possible way. Please feel free to fork. I am also looking forward to know more about different technologies, languages and concepts. Your pull request will always be welcome.

Happy learning!
