## Welcome to TechLearn
I created this repository to track things that I have learnt over a period of time. It helps me to stay in touch with them and refer them as and when needed.
Please open [https://imsatyam.github.io/techlearn/](https://imsatyam.github.io/techlearn/) for better view.

## What it has?
Each concept has:
 * *video link(s):* An exhaustive detail of the concept through videos.
 * *textual link(s):* An exhaustive detail of the concept as a pdf or webpage link. It helps in brushing up concepts easily.
 * *notes:* crisp notes on the salient points of the concept. Helps in revision.

## Collaboration
It will be great if this repository can help you in any possible way. Please feel free to fork. I am also looking forward to know more about different technologies, languages and concepts. Your pull request will always be welcome.

Happy learning!
