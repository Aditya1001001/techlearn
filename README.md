## Welcome to TechLearn
I created this repository to track things that I have learnt over a period of time. It helps me to stay in touch with them and refer them as and when needed.

## What it has?
This repository groups the concepts and technologies into logical groups. For example, every software developer needs to know about the data structures, hence data structure becomes a part of **Fundamentals**. Similarly, being a Java programmer, I have grouped java concepts under the name **Java**. 

Each concept has:
 * *video link(s):* An exhaustive detail of the concept through videos.
 * *textual link(s):* An exhaustive detail of the concept as a pdf or webpage link. It helps in brushing up concepts easily.
 * *notes:* crisp notes on the salient points of the concept.

## Collaboration
It will be great if this repository can help you in any possible way. Please feel free to fork. I am also looking forward to know more about different technologies, languages and concepts. Your pull request will always be welcome.

Happy learning!
