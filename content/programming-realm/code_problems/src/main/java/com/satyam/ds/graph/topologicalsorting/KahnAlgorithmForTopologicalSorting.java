/**

 The approach is based on the below fact :

 A DAG G has at least one vertex with in-degree 0 and one vertex with out-degree 0.
 Proof: Thereâ€™s a simple proof to the above fact is that a DAG does not contain a cycle which means that all paths will be of finite length.
 Now let S be the longest path from u(source) to v(destination). Since S is the longest path there can be no incoming edge to u and no outgoing edge from v,
 if this situation had occurred then S would not have been the longest path
 => indegree(u) = 0 and outdegree(v) = 0



 Algorithm:

 Steps involved in finding the topological ordering of a DAG:

 Step-1: Compute in-degree (number of incoming edges) for each of the vertex present in the DAG and initialize the count of visited nodes as 0.

 Step-2: Pick all the vertices with in-degree as 0 and add them into a queue (Enqueue operation)

 Step-3: Remove a vertex from the queue (Dequeue operation) and then.

 Increment count of visited nodes by 1.
 Decrease in-degree by 1 for all its neighboring nodes.
 If in-degree of a neighboring nodes is reduced to zero, then add it to the queue.
 Step 5: Repeat Step 3 until the queue is empty.

 Step 5: If count of visited nodes is not equal to the number of nodes in the graph then the topological sort is not possible for the given graph.



 Finding in-degree of a node:

 1) Traverse the array of edges and simply increase the counter of the destination node by 1.
     for each node in Nodes
        indegree[node] = 0;
     for each edge(src,dest) in Edges
        indegree[dest]++

 2) Traverse the list for every node and then increment the in-degree of all the nodes connected to it by 1
     for each node in Nodes
        If (list[node].size()!=0) then
     for each dest in list
        indegree[dest]++;
