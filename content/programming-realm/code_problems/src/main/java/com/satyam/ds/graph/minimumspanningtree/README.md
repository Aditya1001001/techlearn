## Minimum Spanning Tree - Problem Statement
Given connected graph G with positive edge weights, find a min weight set of edges that connects all of the vertices.

## Applications

##### Network design
  - telephone, electrical, hydraulic, TV cable, computer, road
  
##### Approximation algorithms for NP-hard problems.
  - traveling salesperson problem
  - Steiner tree

##### Cluster analysis
  - k clustering problem can be viewed as finding an MST and deleting the k-1 most expensive edges.
  
##### Indirect applications
  - max bottleneck paths
  - LDPC codes for error correction
  - image registration with Renyi entropy
  - learning salient features for real-time face verification
  - reducing data storage in sequencing amino acids in a protein
  - model locality of particle interactions in turbulent fluid flows
  - autoconfig protocol for Ethernet bridging to avoid cycles in a network
