 LC #191
 Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and return the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

 Input: 00000000000000000000000000001011
 Output: 3


 Idea:
     Number of 1 bits is also called Hamming weight.
     1. Integer.bitCount(n);
     2. Brian Kernighanâ€™s algorithm."
