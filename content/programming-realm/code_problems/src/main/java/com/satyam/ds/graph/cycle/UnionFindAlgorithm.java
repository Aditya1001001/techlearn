/**

 A disjoint-set data structure is a data structure that keeps track of a set of elements partitioned into a number of disjoint (non-overlapping) subsets.
 A union-find algorithm is an algorithm that performs two useful operations on such a data structure:

 Find: Determine which subset a particular element is in. This can be used for determining if two elements are in the same subset.

 Union: Join two subsets into a single subset.

 Union-Find Algorithm can be used to check whether an undirected graph contains cycle or not.

 This method assumes that the graph doesnâ€™t contain any self-loops.
