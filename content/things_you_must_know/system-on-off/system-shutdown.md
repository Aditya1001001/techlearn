## System Shutdown - Detailed Steps
Following steps are performed behind the scene when we shutdown a system:

### A user check takes place
When other users are logged in to the computer (using another account on the same PC), 
you’re alerted. Do you really want to shut down? 
Those users may be running programs or have unsaved documents. 
Clicking No cancels the operation, which is the proper thing to do.


### Programs close
System shuts down any programs or processes that you’ve begun or that “belong” to you. 
It sifts through that list and sends every program the shutdown signal. 
If a program contains unsaved data, you’re prompted to save the data to continue


### User is logged out
After programs (and processes) belonging to you, the human, are stopped, system logs you out, 
ending your session.

### System is halted
System begins shutting down bits and pieces of itself. 
These programs, services, and processes are all ended, 
and it is ensured that they end properly and have no social issues or gripes.

### Shutdown signal is sent
A signal is sent to the computer’s power management hardware to turn off the power. 
If that feature isn’t present, a message appears on the screen, something like It is now safe to turn off this computer and get back to real life.
