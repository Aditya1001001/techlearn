Generally, if we are asked to design a game, following points can be considered:

1. Do I need to design/implement both the front end as well as backend code?

2. In case frontend is trivial or can be designed separately, then perhaps the intention and focus
   must be around designing of the game using object oriented principles.
   
3. Design with proper object models and interfaces. It may be a good idea to create bigger classes
   first so that we do not lose track of these classes while designing smaller classes. 
   For example, while designing chess, it might be a good idea to create Board class first. 
   However, if we are totally familiar with the possible classes, we can start with smaller classes as well.
