## Summary
System design problems need a methodical approach. Before solving the problems please go through following blog posts:

 * [Things you need to know before system design interview](http://blog.gainlo.co/index.php/2015/10/22/8-things-you-need-to-know-before-system-design-interviews/)
 * [Ace a system design interview](https://www.palantir.com/how-to-ace-a-systems-design-interview/)

In short, system design problems can be summarized as under:

> Given an open-ended problem, how do you analyze the issue, how do you solve it step by step, how do you explain your idea and discuss with others, how do you evaluate your system and optimize it.

## Fundamentals
We need to cover following topic at the very least to be comfortable with system design problems:
  
  * **Abstraction:** How to abstract a system -what is visible and invisible from other components. Applying OOP concept to solve the problem is a big plus.
  
  * **Database:** We must know the fundamentals of RDBMS. It is important to know about the scenarios where noSQL can be applied. It helps to have basic knowledge of different noSQL databases and concepts like sharding, master-slave etc. 

  * **Network:** Fundamentals of TCP, HTTP, DNS lookup along with the basic understanding of routers and switches.
  
  * **Availability and Scalability:** It is about making system available and scalable. It includes discussion on load-balancer, up-time, requests-per-minute etc.
  
  * **Concurrency:** Can we run things in parallel? What are the possible issues - race-condition, deadlock etc. Java programmer must have an above average hold on concurrency package.
  
  * **Operating system:** Understanding of file system, paging and context-switch.
  
  * **UML:** Drawing class or sequence diagram while discussing low level design.
  
  * **ERD:** Basic understanding and ability to draw an ER diagram helps.
